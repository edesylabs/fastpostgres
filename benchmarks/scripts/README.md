### Database Connection
- **Host:** localhost
- **User:** postgres
- **Database:** fastpostgres

## Interpreting Results

### Connection Performance
Higher connections/second indicates better connection handling capability.

### Query Performance
Higher queries/second indicates faster query processing.

- Similar connection latency (~0.024s)

## Customization

You can modify the scripts to:
- Change the number of concurrent connections
- Adjust query counts
- Test different query types
- Add custom performance metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Database not accessible
If you see connection errors:
```bash
# Check if containers are running
docker-compose ps

# Restart the services
docker-compose restart fastpostgres postgres

# Check logs
docker-compose logs fastpostgres
docker-compose logs postgres
```

### Permission denied
Make sure scripts are executable:
```bash
chmod +x benchmarks/scripts/*.sh
```

## Contributing

Feel free to add more benchmark scripts or improve existing ones. Please ensure:
- Scripts are well-documented
- Include error handling
- Provide clear output formatting
- Test with both databases
