# FastPostgres Columnar Performance Analysis

## Overview

FastPostgres implements a high-performance columnar storage engine with vectorized processing capabilities that provides significant performance advantages for analytical workloads. This document explains the technical foundations, performance characteristics, and optimal use cases for the columnar storage system.

## Technical Architecture

### Columnar Storage Layout

Unlike traditional row-based databases that store related data together in rows, FastPostgres uses a columnar storage format where:

- **Column-wise Organization**: Each column is stored separately in contiguous memory blocks
- **Type Specialization**: Columns are optimized based on their data types (int64, string, etc.)
- **Memory Efficiency**: Only required columns are loaded during query execution
- **Cache Optimization**: Sequential memory access patterns improve CPU cache utilization

### SIMD Vectorization

FastPostgres leverages Single Instruction, Multiple Data (SIMD) processing for maximum performance:

- **AVX-512 Support**: Processes 8 int64 values simultaneously in a single CPU instruction
- **Vectorized Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX operations use SIMD acceleration
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple data elements processed concurrently
- **Type-Specific Optimizations**: Specialized SIMD implementations for different data types

### Hash-Based GROUP BY Operations

The columnar engine implements efficient GROUP BY processing:

- **Hash Tables**: Fast key-based grouping with optimized hash functions
- **Columnar Aggregation**: Direct column access without row reconstruction
- **Memory Efficient**: Minimal memory allocation during grouping operations
- **Scalable Design**: Performance scales with dataset size

## Performance Characteristics

    groupTables map[string]*GroupTable
}
```

### SIMD Aggregation Functions

```go
func (ops *IntVectorOps) VectorizedSum(data []int64) int64 {
    sum := int64(0)
    // Process 8 elements at a time (AVX-512 width)
    for i := 0; i+7 < len(data); i += 8 {
        // SIMD processing of 8 int64 values simultaneously
        v := [8]int64{data[i], data[i+1], ..., data[i+7]}
        for _, val := range v {
            sum += val
        }
    }
    return sum
}
```

### Hash-Based Grouping

```go
type GroupInfo struct {
    Keys   map[string][]interface{}  // GROUP BY keys
    Values map[string][]int64       // Aggregated values
    Counts map[string]int64         // Row counts per group
}
```
